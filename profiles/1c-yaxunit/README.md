# 1c-yaxunit

1c-live stage 2: approved plan + frozen agreements → YAxUnit tests (TDD, fail on baseline CF). Gate procedure names are literals from `in/agreements.md`.

Public docs snapshot is supplied by the 1c-live harness as `in/docs/`
(YAxUnit site + GitHub, BIA Technologies). SearXNG is optional supplement.
